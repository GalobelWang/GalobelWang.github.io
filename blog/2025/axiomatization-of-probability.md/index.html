In this post, we’ll explore the fundamental concept of a <strong>smooth manifold</strong>.

These spaces are “flat” and have a global coordinate system. However, many interesting spaces are not globally flat.</p> <p>Consider the surface of a sphere, \(S^2\). Locally, any small patch on the sphere looks like a piece of the flat plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\). But globally, you can’t map the entire sphere to a single flat plane without distortion (think of world maps). The sphere is a simple example of a manifold.</p> <p>In machine learning:</p> <ul> <li>The set of all probability distributions of a certain type (e.g., all Gaussian distributions) forms a manifold. The parameters (mean and covariance) live in this space.</li> <li>The set of weight matrices for a neural network layer, perhaps with some normalization constraints (e.g., weights on a sphere, orthogonal matrices), can form a manifold.</li> <li>The loss function of a neural network is a function \(L: \mathcal{W} \to \mathbb{R}\), where \(\mathcal{W}\) is the space of all possible weights. This space \(\mathcal{W}\) is typically a very high-dimensional manifold (often just \(\mathbb{R}^N\) for unconstrained networks, but its geometry under a suitable metric, like the Fisher Information Metric, can be non-trivial).</li> </ul> <p>Differential geometry provides the tools to perform calculus on these more general spaces.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-smooth-manifold">What is a Smooth Manifold?</h3> <p>Intuitively, an \(n\)-dimensional manifold is a space that, if you “zoom in” enough at any point, looks like an open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\).</p> <blockquote class="box-definition"> <div class="title"> <p><strong>Definition.</strong> An <strong>\(n\)-dimensional topological manifold</strong> \(M\)</p> </div> <p>A topological space \(M\) is an \(n\)-dimensional topological manifold if:</p> <ol> <li>\(M\) is <strong>Hausdorff</strong>: Any two distinct points have disjoint open neighborhoods.</li> <li>\(M\) is <strong>second-countable</strong>: \(M\) has a countable basis for its topology.

We need at least two charts to cover \(S^1\). A common way is using angular parameterizations:</p> <ul> <li>Chart 1: Let \(U_1 = S^1 \setminus \{(1,0)\}\) (circle minus the point \((1,0)\)). Define \(\phi_1: U_1 \to (0, 2\pi)\) by \(\phi_1(\cos\theta, \sin\theta) = \theta\).</li> <li>Chart 2: Let \(U_2 = S^1 \setminus \{(-1,0)\}\) (circle minus the point \((-1,0)\)). Define \(\phi_2: U_2 \to (-\pi, \pi)\) by \(\phi_2(\cos\theta, \sin\theta) = \theta\).</li> </ul> <p>Consider the overlap. For instance, take the upper semi-circle, corresponding to \(\theta \in (0, \pi)\). Points here are in both \(U_1\) and \(U_2\). \(\phi_1(U_1 \cap U_2) = (0, \pi) \cup (\pi, 2\pi)\). \(\phi_2(U_1 \cap U_2) = (-\pi, 0) \cup (0, \pi)\).</p> <p>Let \(p \in U_1 \cap U_2\). If \(\phi_1(p) = \theta_1 \in (0, \pi)\), then \(\phi_2(p) = \theta_1\). The transition map \(\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1}(\theta_1) = \theta_1\). If \(\phi_1(p) = \theta_1 \in (\pi, 2\pi)\) (e.g., lower semi-circle), then \(\phi_2(p) = \theta_1 - 2\pi\). The transition map \(\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1}(\theta_1) = \theta_1 - 2\pi\). These transition functions are smooth (linear, in fact). (Another common way to define charts for spheres is using stereographic projection).</p> </blockquote> <p>Other examples of smooth manifolds:</p> <ul> <li>Any open subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is an \(n\)-manifold (with a single chart: the identity map).</li> <li>The sphere \(S^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid \Vert x \Vert = 1\}\).</li> <li>The torus \(T^n = S^1 \times \dots \times S^1\) (\(n\) times).</li> <li>The space of \(m \times n\) matrices, \(\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\), which is just Euclidean space.</li> <li> <strong>Lie groups:</strong> Manifolds with a compatible group structure.

Similarly, a map \(F: M \to N\) between two smooth manifolds is smooth if its representation in local coordinates is smooth. Loss functions in ML are typically assumed to be smooth (or at least twice differentiable) on the parameter manifold.</p> <h3 id="tangent-vectors-and-tangent-spaces">Tangent Vectors and Tangent Spaces</h3> <p>Now that we have a notion of a smooth manifold, we want to do calculus. The first step is to define derivatives. On a manifold, derivatives are captured by <strong>tangent vectors</strong>.</p> <p>Intuitively, a tangent vector at a point \(p \in M\) is a vector that “points along” a curve passing through \(p\), representing the instantaneous velocity of the curve.</p> <p>There are several equivalent ways to define tangent vectors:</p> <h5 id="a-equivalence-classes-of-curves-intuitive">a) Equivalence Classes of Curves (Intuitive)</h5> <p>A smooth curve through \(p \in M\) is a smooth map \(\gamma: (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to M\) such that \(\gamma(0) = p\). Two curves \(\gamma_1, \gamma_2\) through \(p\) are considered equivalent if their representations in any local chart \((U, \phi)\) around \(p\) have the same derivative (velocity vector in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)) at \(t=0\):</p> \[\frac{d}{dt}(\phi \circ \gamma_1)(t) \Big\vert_{t=0} = \frac{d}{dt}(\phi \circ \gamma_2)(t) \Big\vert_{t=0}\] <p>A tangent vector at \(p\) is an equivalence class of such curves. The set of all tangent vectors at \(p\) is the <strong>tangent space</strong> \(T_p M\). This space can be shown to have the structure of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space.</p> <h5 id="b-derivations-abstract-and-powerful">b) Derivations (Abstract and Powerful)</h5> <p>A <strong>derivation</strong> at a point \(p \in M\) is a linear map \(v: C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}\) (where \(C^\infty(M)\) is the space of smooth real-valued functions on \(M\)) satisfying the Leibniz rule (product rule):</p> \[v(fg) = f(p)v(g) + g(p)v(f) \quad \text{for all } f, g \in C^\infty(M)\] <p>It can be shown that the set of all derivations at \(p\) forms an \(n\)-dimensional vector space, and this vector space is isomorphic to the tangent space defined via curves. This is often taken as the formal definition of \(T_p M\).</p> <blockquote class="box-definition"> <div class="title"> <p><strong>Definition.</strong> <strong>Tangent Space \(T_p M\)</strong></p> </div> <p>The <strong>tangent space</strong> to a smooth manifold \(M\) at a point \(p \in M\), denoted \(T_p M\), is the vector space of all derivations at \(p\). An element \(v \in T_p M\) is called a <strong>tangent vector</strong> at \(p\). If \(M\) is an \(n\)-dimensional manifold, then \(T_p M\) is an \(n\)-dimensional real vector space.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given a chart \((U, \phi)\) with local coordinates \((x^1, \dots, x^n)\) around \(p\), a natural basis for \(T_p M\) is given by the partial derivative operators with respect to these coordinates, evaluated at \(p\):</p> \[\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\Big\vert_p, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\Big\vert_p \right\}\] <p>Here, \(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big\vert_p\) is the derivation that acts on a function \(f \in C^\infty(M)\) as:</p> \[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big\vert_p\right)(f) := \frac{\partial (f \circ \phi^{-1})}{\partial u^i} \Big\vert_{\phi(p)}\] <p>where \((u^1, \dots, u^n)\) are the standard coordinates on \(\mathbb{R}^n\) corresponding to \(\phi(U)\).

If we consider a path \(\gamma(t)\) with \(\gamma(0)=p\) and velocity \(\gamma'(0) = v\), then the directional derivative of \(f\) along \(v\) is \(D_v f(p) = \nabla f(p) \cdot v\). On a manifold, the concept analogous to the gradient is related to the <strong>differential</strong> \(df_p\) of a function \(f: M \to \mathbb{R}\). This differential \(df_p\) is an element of the <em>cotangent space</em> \(T_p^\ast M\) (the dual space of \(T_p M\)). It acts on tangent vectors: \(df_p(v) = v(f)\). If the manifold has a Riemannian metric (Part 2), there’s a natural way to identify tangent vectors with cotangent vectors. This allows us to define a <strong>gradient vector field</strong> \(\text{grad } f\) (or \(\nabla f\)) which is a tangent vector field. Its components in a local coordinate system are related to the partial derivatives \(\partial f / \partial x^i\). For now, think of tangent vectors as the “directions” in which one can move from \(p\), and \(T_p M\) is the space where these directions (and eventually gradients) live.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="the-differential-pushforward-of-a-smooth-map">The Differential (Pushforward) of a Smooth Map</h3> <p>If we have a smooth map \(F: M \to N\) between two smooth manifolds, it induces a linear map between their tangent spaces at corresponding points.</p> <blockquote class="box-definition"> <div class="title"> <p><strong>Definition.</strong> <strong>Differential (or Pushforward)</strong></p> </div> <p>Let \(F: M \to N\) be a smooth map between smooth manifolds.
