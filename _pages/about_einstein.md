I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Guangyue Han](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~ghan/). 

I am broadly interested in information theory, especially in problems related to algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. I am currently working on the Gaussian complete monotonicity conjecture and exploring the potential applications of Hodge structures in information theory and the heat equation.

Prior to the University of Hong Kong, I have worked on Dynamic System and Algebraic Topology with [Prof. Alexey Nikitin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexey-Nikitin-3) and [Prof. Tatiana N. Fomenko](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q5VuN08AAAAJ). I received the [Bachelor of Science degree](https://galobelwang.github.io/file/MSU.pdf) in mathematics from Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2024.
