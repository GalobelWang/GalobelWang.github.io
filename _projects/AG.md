**Lyapunov Stability Theory**, founded by the Russian mathematician Alexander Mikhailovich Lyapunov (1857–1918), provides a systematic framework for analyzing the stability of dynamical systems. It equips the study of nonlinear dynamics with powerful mathematical tools and occupies a foundational position in control theory, dynamical systems, and applied mathematics.

The central idea is to assess stability by constructing an energy-like scalar function—**a Lyapunov function**—rather than by explicitly solving the underlying differential equations. In analogy with energy dissipation in physical systems, if this “energy” decreases monotonically along system trajectories, the system tends toward a stable state. Within this framework, one formalizes several notions of stability—**Lyapunov (stability in the sense of Lyapunov), asymptotic stability,** and **exponential stability**—thus providing a rigorous taxonomy of dynamical behavior.

Two complementary methodologies underpin the theory. **The direct method (Lyapunov’s second method)** analyzes global or semi-global stability properties by exhibiting an appropriate Lyapunov function. **The indirect method (Lyapunov’s first method)** infers local stability near an equilibrium by studying the **linearization** of the nonlinear system. Taken together, these approaches enable the treatment of a broad class of practical stability problems.
