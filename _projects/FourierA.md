Fourier series are named after the distinguished French mathematical physicist Joseph Fourier (1768–1830). In the early nineteenth century, Fourier worked on the theory of heat conduction and, in 1822, published his monumental treatise *Théorie analytique de la chaleur*, in which he made extensive use of the type of series that now bears his name. Strictly speaking, Fourier studied trigonometric polynomials; according to many historians, his direct contributions to a rigorous mathematical theory of Fourier series were limited. Nevertheless, such series were already well known to Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813), and other scholars prior to Fourier.
