**Chapter 1** serves as an introduction to indefinite integrals, presenting the basic concepts and foundational theory that underlie the material to follow.

**Chapter 2** treats **parameter-dependent proper integrals**, defining integrals that depend on a parameter and examining their properties and methods of evaluation.

**Chapters 3 and 4** address **improper parameter-dependent integrals of the first kind** (infinite limits of integration) and **of the second kind** (unbounded integrands), respectively, with emphasis on convergence, computational techniques, and applications.

**Chapter 5** concerns **improper integrals and the interchange of limits**, studying the interchange of limiting operations with the improper integral sign, as well as continuity, differentiation, and integration with respect to a parameter for improper integrals, and the evaluation of integrals in the presence of two singularities.

**Chapter 6** covers **Euler integrals**, giving a detailed account of the first and second kindsâ€”their definitions, properties, and applications in mathematical analysis.
