**Complex Analysis**—also known as the theory of functions of a complex variable—is a major branch of mathematics devoted to the study of complex-valued functions. It extends the concepts of real analysis to the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ and reveals distinctive, deeply structured phenomena unique to complex functions.

At its core lies the notion of **analyticity (holomorphy)**. In striking contrast to the real case, holomorphic functions exhibit remarkable rigidity: analyticity on a domain entails differentiability of all orders and representation by a convergent power series throughout the domain. This rigidity underpins foundational results such as **Cauchy’s integral theorem** (and formula) and the **residue theorem**, which are not only elegant in their own right but also extraordinarily effective for computation.

Principal tools of the subject include complex integration, series expansions (Taylor and **Laurent** series), **analytic continuation**, and **conformal mappings**. **Residue calculus** provides refined methods for evaluating otherwise intractable real integrals, while conformal mapping plays a central role in applications to fluid mechanics, heat conduction, and related areas. Fundamental results—such as the **Riemann mapping theorem** and the **maximum modulus principle**—furnish a robust theoretical framework for analyzing the behavior of complex functions.
