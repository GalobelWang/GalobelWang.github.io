**Abstract algebra** is the modern branch of mathematics devoted to the study of algebraic structures; it abstracts the concrete operations of classical algebra in order to investigate the general properties shared by a wide variety of mathematical systems. Its development epitomizes the shift in mathematical thought from explicit computation to the analysis of abstract structure.

At its core, abstract algebra studies algebraic structures formed by sets equipped with operations. The most fundamental examples are **groups**, **rings**, and **fields**. Groups capture the essence of symmetry, as exemplified by permutation groups and Lie groups; rings generalize the addition and multiplication of the integers and play a central role in algebraic number theory; and fields furnish the theoretical framework for solving equationsâ€”within which **Galois theory** provides the celebrated resolution of the classical question of whether general quintic equations admit solutions by radicals.
