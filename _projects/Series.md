**Chapter 1** offers a brief history of series, sketching the development of the theory and providing the historical context and conceptual groundwork for the material that follows.

**Chapter 2** treats **infinite numerical series**, presenting fundamental concepts and convergence criteria (e.g., the Cauchy criterion, root test, ratio test). It also introduces **generalized summability methods for divergent series** (such as **Cesàro summation** and the **Poisson–Abel method** via power series), together with operations on numerical series, including **addition, Cauchy products, infinite products,** and **double series**.

**Chapter 3** addresses **series of functions**, with emphasis on the convergence of sequences and series of functions—**pointwise** and **uniform convergence**—and their interaction with integration and differentiation. Further topics include **mean convergence (summability)**, the **equicontinuity** of families of functions, and conditions under which **iterated limits** may be interchanged.

**Chapter 4** assembles **basic mathematical tools**, reviewing properties of **finite sums**, **Taylor expansions** of standard elementary functions, and the **Taylor series for the binomial function**, thereby furnishing key instruments for applications of series theory.
