Évariste Galois (1811–1832) was among the most influential mathematicians of the nineteenth century. Though he died at the age of twenty, his creation of what is now called **Galois theory** fundamentally reshaped algebra and laid crucial foundations for modern mathematics.

Galois theory, a cornerstone of modern algebra, forges a deep link between **group theory** and **field theory** by relating the solvability of polynomial equations to the structure of their **Galois groups**. The central idea is to study the permutation symmetries of a polynomial’s roots in order to understand the properties of the equation itself. Galois proved the seminal theorem that a polynomial equation is **solvable by radicals** if and only if its Galois group is a **solvable group**. This result not only settled the centuries-old question of the nonexistence of a general radical solution for quintic equations but also inaugurated a new paradigm for investigating algebraic structures.
