**Real Analysis** is the branch of mathematics concerned with the real number system and real-valued functions. Built on the rigorous ε–δ notion of limits, it systematically studies continuity, differentiability, and integrability. Core topics include measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and the theory of function spaces (e.g., $L^p$ spaces). Measure theory extends the notion of length/area/volume to a σ-algebra of sets and furnishes the foundation for modern integration; the Lebesgue integral substantially generalizes the Riemann integral and, under broad hypotheses, legitimizes the interchange of limiting operations with integration. Beyond its intrinsic structural coherence, real analysis provides fundamental tools for probability theory, harmonic analysis, and related areas.

**Functional Analysis** generalizes the concepts of real analysis to abstract—typically infinite-dimensional—linear spaces, chiefly function spaces, together with the operators acting on them. Originating in the early twentieth century through the work of Hilbert, Banach, and others, it treats functions as points of topological vector spaces and investigates their topological and algebraic structures. Central notions include normed and Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, and linear operator theory. Properties such as the completeness of Banach spaces and the orthogonality structure of Hilbert spaces yield powerful methods for the analysis of differential and integral equations.
