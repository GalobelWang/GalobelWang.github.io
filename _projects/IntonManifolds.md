**Chapter 1** covers preparatory material, including an introduction to analysis and integration, as well as the foundational theories of **Jordan measure** and **Lebesgue measure**.

**Chapters 2 and 3** treat **double** and **multiple integrals**, respectively, presenting the basic concepts, the **Darboux integral**, **Riemann integrability**, and **Fubini’s theorem**, together with practical tools such as the **change-of-variables formula** and **volume computations**.

**Chapter 4** studies **improper integrals**, including fundamental notions and the theory of improper integrals with **nonnegative** terms and with **sign-changing** terms.

**Chapters 5 and 6** address **line integrals** and **surface integrals**, encompassing **Green’s theorem**, **surface area** formulas, **Stokes’ theorem**, and the **Gauss–Ostrogradsky (divergence) theorem**.

**Chapter 7** is devoted to **parameter-dependent integrals**, covering proper parameter-dependent integrals, the two classes of **improper parameter-dependent integrals**, and **Euler integrals**.

**Chapter 8** provides an introduction to **field theory**, focusing on basic concepts such as **tensors** and **invariants**.
