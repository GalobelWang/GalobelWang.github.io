**Numerical linear algebra** is a major branch of computational mathematics concerned with numerical methods, error analysis, and algorithmic implementation for large-scale linear-algebraic problems. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework—including the notions of metric, normed, and Euclidean spaces—it is tightly coupled to practical demands of modern computing. Core topics include: 
* the solution of linear systems by **direct methods** (e.g., LU and Cholesky factorizations) and **iterative methods** (e.g., the Jacobi method, conjugate-gradient and related Krylov subspace algorithms); 
* the computation of **eigenvalues and eigenvectors**, employing techniques such as the **QR algorithm** and **Householder transformations**; 
* **perturbation theory and error analysis**, addressing numerical stability and the propagation of errors throughout the computation. 
The field also emphasizes issues of implementation, notably the characteristics of floating-point arithmetic and the control of rounding errors. As a foundational tool of contemporary scientific computing, numerical linear algebra underpins applications across engineering computation, data analysis, and scientific simulation.
