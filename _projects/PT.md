**The modern theoretical framework of probability theory and mathematical statistics was established chiefly by Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903–1987).** In his pioneering 1933 monograph, *Foundations of the Theory of Probability*, he introduced a rigorous measure-theoretic, axiomatic system for probability, thereby providing the subject with a solid mathematical foundation.

**Kolmogorov’s axiomatization** defines a probability space as a triple $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$, where $\Omega$ is the sample space, $\mathcal{F}$ a σ-algebra, and $\mathbb{P}$ a probability measure. This framework not only unified the treatment of discrete and continuous models but also laid the groundwork for the development of stochastic process theory. Among his other major contributions are **Kolmogorov’s zero–one law**, the **Kolmogorov forward and backward equations** for Markov processes, and the theory of **Kolmogorov complexity**.

**Building on this foundation, modern probability and mathematical statistics have flourished**, encompassing the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, Markov processes, and martingale theory. These tools play central roles in financial mathematics, statistical physics, information theory, and machine learning. On the statistical side, the theory supports key methodologies such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, thereby undergirding data analysis and scientific decision-making.
