Huh</a> solved several long-standing open problems on log-concave sequences in combinatorics. The ground-breaking techniques developed in those work are from algebraic geometry: “We believe that behind any log-concave sequence that appears in nature there is such a Hodge structure responsible for the log-concavity”.</p> <p>A function is called completely monotone if its derivatives alternate in signs; e.g., $e^{-t}$. A fundamental conjecture in mathematical physics and Shannon information theory is on the complete monotonicity of Gaussian distribution (GCM conjecture), which states that $I(X+Z_t)$ is completely monotone in $t$, where $I$ is Fisher information, random variables $X$ and $Z_t$ are independent and $Z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,t)$ is Gaussian. Inspired by the algebraic geometry method introduced by J. Huh, GCMC is reformulated in the form of a log-convex sequence. In general, a completely monotone function can admit a log-convex sequence and a log-convex sequence can further induce a log-concave sequence. The new formulation may guide GCM conjecture to the marvelous temple of algebraic geometry.</p> <p>In another formulation, Gaussian completely monotone conjecture is referred to as: the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. Recent progress on this topic is due to Guillaume Wang. In his article, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979490" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">A Higher-Order Otto Calculus Approach to the Gaussian Completely Monotone Conjecture</a>, he have proven the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension.

Moreover, these <em>Grothendieck toposes</em> are particular cases of <em>elementary toposes</em>, which are “nice” categories with properties analogous to those of the category of sets that play an important role in logic.</p> <p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/17/5/3253" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Baudot and Bennequin</a> first identified Shannon’s discrete entropy as a toposic invariant of certain categories of discrete observables. <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/38/35-38abs.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Juan Pablo Vigneaux</a> and a series of articles extended their results in several directions.

A model is called exactly solvable when observables of interest can be computed by a formula involving well-known functions (rational functions, $\exp$, $\sin$, $\Gamma$), so that the complexity of the formula does not increase as parameters go to $\infty$.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://galobelwang.github.io/file/IntegrableProbabilityIntroduction.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Introduction to Integrable Probability</a></li> <li><a href="https://galobelwang.github.io/file/IntegrableProbabilityRepresentation.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Topics in Representation Theory</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="statistical-mechanics">Statistical mechanics</h3> <p>The field of applications of probabilistic ideas was considerably expanded in the XIX century. Most notably, Ludwig Boltzmann (Austria, 1844-1906) proposed that thermodynamic macroscopic observables, such as the temperature and the entropy, could be explained from microscopic considerations, using a probabilistic description of the possible configurations of the molecules that compose a given substance. For this, it was necessary to take limits as the number of particles goes to infinity and/or to consider continuous models (particles distributed in Euclidean space).</p> <p>Boltzmann ideas were further developed by Josiah Williard Gibbs (USA, 1839-1903), who also coined the term <strong>statistical mechanics</strong>. For instance, Boltzmann proposed that the entropy $S$ of a system is given by \(S=k_B \log(\#\text{ microscopic configurations of the system}),\) when all the configurations $X$ are equiprobable and the argument of the logarithm is finite. Here $k_B$ denotes a universal constant (Boltzmann’s constant). More generally, Gibbs gave the formula \(S= - k_B \sum_{x\in X} p(x) \log p(x),\) where $p:X\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ satisfies $\sum_{x\in X} p(x) = 1$.</p> <p>In actual systems, the number of configurations is a priori infinite. The formulas above only make sense on finite portions of the system, and one is forced to consider a limiting procedure. The simplest setting on which one can perform this kind of limiting operation is the <em>Ising model</em>: Consider a finite and discrete set $\Lambda \subset \mathbb Z^2$ of sites organized in a square array. Let $s_{x,y}\in \lbrace +1,-1 \rbrace$ be a “spin” associated to the site $(x,y)\in \Lambda$. Then $\vec s = \lbrace s_{x,y} \rbrace_{(x,y)\in \Lambda}$ is a possible configuration of the system. The energy of this configuration is given by the Hamiltonian: \(\mathcal{H}(\vec s, BC) = - \sum\limits_{(x,y)} s_{x,y} \left(s_{x+1,y} + s_{x,y+1} \right) - h \sum\limits_{(x,y)} s_{x,y}\) Because of the interactions between neighbors in the sum, the hamiltonian depends on some given boundary conditions $BC$. Remark that two neighboring spins that are equal decrease the energy. The Boltzmann-Gibb’s theory postulates that, in equilibrium, the configurations of the system are distributed according to the probability law \(\mathbb P(\vec s) \propto \exp \left(- \frac{\mathcal{H}(\vec s)}{k_B T} \right),\) where $T$ is the temperature of the system. This is called today a <em>Gibb’s state.</em></p> <p>It turns out that the ``typical’’ or more probable configurations are very different, depending on the value of $T$. If $T$ is much smaller that a certain <em>critical temperature</em> $T_c$, then the alignment tendency of the spins predominates and one sees big clusters with the same spin. Whereas if $T\gg T_c$, disorder predominates. A phase transition happens at $T_c$. In fact, this $T_c$ is only well defined in the limit where the diameter of $\Lambda$ goes to infinity and the boundary conditions become irrelevant.</p> <p><br></p> <h1 id="algebra-and-geometry">Algebra and Geometry</h1> <h3 id="tropical-algebraic-geometry">Tropical algebraic geometry</h3> <p>Tropical geometry is the study of polynomials and their geometric properties when addition is replaced with minimization and multiplication is replaced with ordinary addition:</p> <ul> <li> \[x \oplus y = \min\{x, y\},\] </li> <li> \[x \otimes y = x + y.\] </li> </ul> <p>Tropical geometry is a variant of algebraic geometry in which polynomial graphs resemble piecewise linear meshes, and in which numbers belong to the tropical semiring instead of a field.
